    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>To a beginner, the stock market can appear rather daunting. But equities outperform cash
    and bonds over most medium and long-term periods and easy routes in are not hard to find.
    </p>
    <p>In reality, with dismal returns on offer from banks and building societies,
    investing in shares provides an opportunity to hedge against rising inflation and achieve greater returns than cash,
    bonds and property.</p>
    <br/>
    <h2>The basics of investing</h2>
    <p>In the UK, the main stock market is the London Stock Exchange, where public limited companies and
     other financial instruments such as government bonds and derivatives can be bought and sold.
     The stock market is split into different indices - the most famous in the UK being the FTSE 100,
     comprising the largest 100 companies.
     </p>
     <p>The most well-known indices come from the FTSE group - the FTSE 100, the FTSE 250, the FTSE Fledgling and
     the alternative investment market (Aim), which mainly lists small and venture capital-backed companies.</p>
